# GraalVM R Runtime

GraalVM R runtime, also known as [FastR](https://github.com/oracle/fastr), is a GNU-compatible implementation of the R programming language.
FastR is no longer under active development and is in maintenance mode, however we always welcome contributions from the community!

The last released version is 22.3.1, but FastR continues to be available in a source form. 
See how to [build FastR from source](https://github.com/oracle/fastr/blob/master/documentation/dev/building.md). 
Find FastR 22.3.1 user documentation [here](https://www.graalvm.org/22.3/reference-manual/r/).
