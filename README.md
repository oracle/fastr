# FastR

FastR is an implementation of the [R Language](http://www.r-project.org/) in Java atop [Truffle and Graal](https://github.com/graalvm/).
Truffle is a framework for building self-optimizing AST interpreters.
Graal is a dynamic compiler that is used to generate efficient machine code from partially evaluated Truffle ASTs.

FastR is an open-source effort of Purdue University, Johannes Kepler University Linz, and Oracle Labs.

For more details and instructions for downloading and building the system, please visit the [FastR Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/allr/fastr/wiki/Home).
