 NEWS/ChangeLog for JRI
--------------------------

0.5-5	(under development)
    o	fix compilation in parallel using the -j switch for GNU Make
    o	some more Win64 fixes

0.5-4	2010-09-17
    o	added more options to rniStop() on unix and changed the
	default to use interrupt flags instead of signals since
	signals cause problems in some JVM implmentations. The
	previous behavior can be achieved by rniStop(1).

0.5-3	2010-09-02
    o	fixed changed by the Win64 support which broke some other OSes by
	using sign extension when converting to long storage.

    o	avoid the use of the sign of pointers for signaling. Note
	that rniEval() now returns 0 on error and not -1 or -2. The
	old behavior was undocumented (and dangerous) and thus should
	not be relied upon. (fixes #172)

0.5-2	2010-04-28
    o	fixed handling of NAs in strings - they are now correctly
	converted to <null>s on the Java side.

	IMPORTANT: previously NAs would come as the string "NA"
	from R which is incorrect since it is not distinguishable from
	a literal "NA" string. Code that deals with NAs must be prepared
	to receive nulls in string arrays (note that nulls where
	correctly converted to NA string, it's just that incoming
	string were not converted).

	(Thanks to Stephan Wahlbrink for pointing out the inconsistency)

    o	multiple fixes to Windows support: common command line
	arguments are now correctly processed, sub-architectures are
	supported, Win64 is now also supported

0.5-1	2010-03-16
   o	API 1.10: rniAssign now returns boolean to denote success/failure

   o	numerous bug fixes and additions

0.5-0	2009-08-22
    o	API 1.9: added rniPreserve, rniRelease, rniParentEnv, rniFindVar,
	         rniListEnv, rniSpecialObject, rniPrintValue,
		 rniGetRawArray, rniPutRawArray, rniGetAttrNames methods
		 added jriLoaded field (boolean)

    o	new REngine-based API (org.rosuda.REngine.JRI.JRIEngine)
	has been created - this allows the same code to interface
	JRI or Rserve without re-compilation

	Note: the JAR files are currently shipped separately from the JRI
	installation and can be obtained from
	http://rforge.net/JRI/files/

    o	proxy references are now preserved until finalized

    o	if jri.ignore.ule=yes property is set, JRI will not abort on
	failing to load the JRI library (UnsatisfiedLinkException).
	This can be used by GUIs to display a more meaningful message
	instead of abort. The jriLoaded flag is false in that case.


0.4-2
    o	declare string encoding as UTF-8 and convert incoming strings
	to UTF-8 if possible (R >= 2.7.0 required).

0.4-1	(part of rJava 0.5-1 and later)
    o	fixed configuration to work with multi-arch builds

0.4-0	2007-08-22 (part of rJava 0.5-0)
    o	adapt to changes in R-devel

    o	add -I. to CFLAGS for compatibility (thanks to BDR)

    o	added RConsoleOuputStream class

    o	API 1.8: added rniPrint, added int oType parameter to the
	rWriteConsole callback

    o	work around broken MinGW runtimes

    o	allow JRI to hook into a running R process (and thusly provide
	rJava with callbacks)

    o	added: inMainRThread(), isStandAlone()

    o	include configure in SVN and don't rebuild it on mkdist

0.3-7	2006-01-14
    o	make sure rniJavaToXref creates a global reference

    o	API 1.7: rniCons can accept two new arguments: tag and lang
	rniLCons was added

    o	assign now supports raw REXPs (XT_NONE)

    o	createRJavaRef was added to create jobjRef R objects from
	Java objects

0.3-6	2006-11-29
    o	adapted to API change in R-devel

    o	fixed double-inclusion of JFLAGS which throws off GIJ

0.3-5	2006-10-06
    o	remove variadic macros to be compatible with compilers
	that don't support C99

0.3-4	2006-09-14
    o	updated Makefiles to force 1.4 target and sources

0.3-3	2006-09-12
    o	fixed API version in Java sources and added version check
	to examples

0.3-2	2006-09-11
    o	New API (1.6): add handling of boolean type

0.3-1	2006-08-31

0.3-0	2006-05-31
    o	New API (1.5) entries: rniGetTAG, rniInherits,
	rniGetSymbolName, rniInstallName
	allows handling of symbols, named lists and inheritance

    o	fixed/improved REXP, RList and RFactor

0.2-5	2006-05-08
    o	Use configure to detect CStackXXX and R_SignalHandlers
	set the latter to 0 if present (solves threading issues)

0.2-4	2006-05-03
    o	added support for pre-configuration passed from rJava

0.2-3	2006-04-20
    o	fix warnings and issues with R 2.3.0

0.2-2	2006-04-11
    o	licensed under LGPL

0.2-1	2006-03-07
    o	fixed Java detection, fixed eval double-unlock,
	use R shlib flags, added FreeBSD support

0.2-0	2005-12-19
    o	switched to autoconf process for configuration/installation 

0.1-0
