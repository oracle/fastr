# Specify output filters for R package testing
# 
# Format (EBNF, sed-like action syntax): 
# filter = pkg_pattern '=>' action .
# pkg_pattern = <REGEX>.
# action = command '/' string ['/' string ].
# command = 'd' | 'D' ['-N'] ['+N'] | 'r' | 'R' | 's'
# string = <unquoted string, slashed must be escaped with backslash>
# N = positive number
# 
# Command description:
#   d      delete exact match of the specified string (i.e. replace by empty string)
#   D      delete line containing the specified string
#   r      replace exact match of the first argument by the second argument
#   R      replace line containing the first argument by the second argument
#   D+3-1  delete line containing the specified string and 1 preceding and 3 following lines
#   s      substitute match of the regular expression with given string (use Python regex syntax)
#
# NOTES:
# The definition order of the filters (in this file) matters. 
# They will be applied in order.
# They will be applied to the outputs of both GNU R and FastR
