FastR is an implementation of the R programming language in Java atop Truffle
and Graal. Truffle is a framework for building self-optimizing AST interpreters.
Graal is a dynamic compiler that is used to generate efficient machine code from
partially evaluated Truffle ASTs.

FastR is an open-source effort of Purdue University, TU Dortmund University,
Johannes Kepler University Linz, and Oracle Labs.

The original GNU R contributors message follows below.

R is a project which is attempting to provide a modern piece of
statistical software for the GNU suite of software.

The current R is the result of a collaborative effort with
contributions from all over the world.


Authors of R.

R was initially written by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka of the
Statistics Department of the University of Auckland.

Since mid-1997 there has been a core group with write access to the R
source, currently consisting of

Douglas Bates
John Chambers
Peter Dalgaard
Seth Falcon
Robert Gentleman
Kurt Hornik
Stefano Iacus
Ross Ihaka
Friedrich Leisch
Uwe Ligges
Thomas Lumley
Martin Maechler
Duncan Murdoch
Paul Murrell
Martyn Plummer
Brian Ripley
Deepayan Sarkar
Duncan Temple Lang
Luke Tierney
Simon Urbanek

plus Heiner Schwarte up to October 1999 and Guido Masarotto up to June 2003.

Current R-core members can be contacted via email to R-project.org
with name made up by replacing spaces by dots in the name listed above.

R would not be what it is today without the invaluable help of these
people, who contributed by donating code, bug fixes and documentation:

Terry Therneau, Rolf Turner, Bill Venables, Gregory R. Warnes,
Andreas Weingessel, Morten Welinder, James Wettenhall, Simon Wood and
Achim Zeileis.

Others have written code that has been adopted by R and is
acknowledged in the code files, including

J. D. Beasley, David J. Best, Richard Brent, Kevin Buhr, Michael
A. Covington, Bill Cleveland, Robert Cleveland,, G. W. Cran,
C. G. Ding, Ulrich Drepper, Paul Eggert, J. O. Evans, David M. Gay,

Turlach, Gary V. Vaughan, Michael Wichura, Jingbo Wang, M. A. Wong,
and the Free Software Foundation (for autoconf code and utilities).

Many more, too numerous to mention here, have contributed by sending bug
reports and suggesting various improvements.

Simon Davies whilst at the University of Auckland wrote the original
version of glm().

Julian Harris and Wing Kwong (Tiki) Wan whilst at the University of
Auckland assisted Ross Ihaka with the original Macintosh port.

R was inspired by the S environment which has been principally
developed by John Chambers, with substantial input from Douglas Bates,
Rick Becker, Bill Cleveland, Trevor Hastie, Daryl Pregibon and
Allan Wilks.

A special debt is owed to John Chambers who has graciously contributed
advice and encouragement in the early days of R and later became a
member of the core team.



The R Foundation may decide to give out <first.lastname>@R-project.org
email addresses to contributors to the R Project (even without making them
members of the R Foundation) when in the view of the R Foundation this
would help advance the R project.

The R Core Group, Roger Bivand, John Fox and Bill Venables are the
ordinary members of the R Foundation.  In addition, Dirk Eddelbuettel,
Torsten Hothorn, David Meyer, Simon Wood, and Achim Zeileis are also
e-addressable by <Firstname>.<Lastname>@R-project.org.
